We call attention to different contexts where information visualization techniques have been successfully used in visual analytic processes. Wikipedia articles show that evolution has motivated interesting visualization developments. In \cite{viegasetal2004}, authors investigate the dynamics of Wikipedia through an exploratory data analysis tool that was effective in revealing patterns within a given article text changes. \cite{watenbergetal2007} proposed a color scheme approach to present edit histories of Wikipedia administrators. Furthermore, many authors \cite{holt1996, lanza2001, rysselberghe2004, voineaetal2005} have studied visualizations to easy control and understand software source code evolution or to map collaborative efforts of various developers. 

In this work, we are interested in the existence and quantification of specific events of change in enzyme hierarchical annotations. As far as we are concerned, there are no other works that propose a visualization for this type of data.
