\section{Problem modeling}
\label{sec:modelling}

Based on numerical and hierarchical nature of Enzyme Classification number, we  proposed a model to characterize the EC changes observed over several versions of UniProt/SwissProt. First of all, our focus was on visualizing what types of changes happens and with what frequency they occur. Moreover, it is important to know the hierarchical level in which a change occurs, since a move in higher levels (leftmost) are more severe than in lower ones, thus we decided to segment changes by common prefix length, number of generalizations and number of specializations a specific EC number has suffered.

An example of EC number change characterized by our model is provided below.

$$3.1.3.2 \rightarrow 3.1.3.5$$

It happened in 77 hydrolases of releases 5 to 6. Observe that the common prefix length is 3 (the first three levels from left to right remains the same), there was 1 generalization (number 2 was deleted) and 1 specialization (number 5 was written). This change means that an acid phosphatase is now classified as a 5'-nucleotidase.

More examples of EC moves characterized by our prefix / generalization / specialization model are provided in Table \ref{tab_ec_change}.
