\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed a technique to visualize evolution in enzyme annotations, in special EC numbers, across several releases of UniProt/SwissProt data base. We modeled the changes of consecutive releases using parameters as the common prefix length and levels of generalization and specialization. The proposed interactive visualization gives a macro view of the changes and presents further details on demand as, for instance, frequencies of types of changes segmented by levels of generalizations and specializations as well as by the enzyme families. Users can further explore entries metadata. By visual means, we were able to evidence trends of specialization and growth of the database as well as detect several exceptions where EC numbers were deleted, divided, created or annotation errors were detected.
