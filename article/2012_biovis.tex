%% Uncomment one of the lines above depending on where your paper is

%% doesn't use a specific qualifier. Further, ``electronic'' includes
%% hyperreferences for more convenient online viewing.

%% Please use one of the ``review'' options in combination with the
%% assigned online id (see below) ONLY if your paper uses a double blind
%% review process. Some conferences, like IEEE Vis and InfoVis, have NOT
%% in the past.

%% Figures should be in CMYK or Grey scale format, otherwise, color

%% These three lines bring in essential packages: ``mathptmx'' for Type 1

%% for proper handling of the times font family.

%% We encourage the use of mathptmx for consistent usage of times font

%% Abstract section.
\abstract{In this paper, we propose an interactive visualization called ADVISe (Annotation Dynamics Visualization) which tackles the problem of visualizing evolution in enzyme annotations across several releases of UniProt/SwissProt database. More specifically, we visualize the dynamics of the EC numbers which are a numerical and hierarchical classification scheme for enzymes, based on the chemical reactions they catalyze. An EC number consists of four numbers separated by periods and represents a progressively finer classification of the catalized reaction. The proposed interactive visualization gives a macro view of the changes and presents further details on demand such as frequencies of change types segmented by levels of generalization and specialization, as well as by enzyme families. Users can also explore entries metadata. With this tool we were able to identify trends of specialization, database growth, exceptions where EC numbers were deleted, divided or created and also changes from past annotation errors.}% end of abstract
