We highlight to different context where information visualization techniques have been succesfuly used in visual analytics processes. Wikipedia articles evolution has motivated interesting visualization developments. In \cite{viegasetal2004}, authors investigate the dynamics of Wikipedia through an exploratory data analysis tool which was effective in revealing patterns within the article text changes. \cite{watenbergetal2007} proposed a color scheme approach to present edit histories of Wikipedia administrators. Furthermore, many authors \cite{holt1996, lanza2001, rysselberghe2004, voineaetal2005} have studied visualizations to easy control and understanding software source code evolution or in mapping collaborative efforts of various developers. 

In this work, we are interested in existence and quantification of specific events of change in enzyme hierarchical annotations. As far as we are concerned there are not other works that propose a visualization for this type of data.
